      <h1>The Action Attribute</h1>
      <p>
      The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.<br/>

      The common way to submit a form to a server, is by using a submit button.<br/>

      Normally, the form is submitted to a web page on a web server.<br/>

      In the example above, a server-side script is specified to handle the submitted form:</p>


      <form action="action_page.php">


      <p>If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.</p>


      <h1>The Method Attribute</h1>

      <p>The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or  POST) to be used when submitting the forms:</p>


      <form action="action_page.php" method="get"><br/>

      or:<br/>


      <form action="action_page.php" method="post"><br/>


      <h2>When to Use GET?</h2>

      <p>You can use GET (the default method):<br/>

      If the form submission is passive (like a search engine query), and without sensitive information.<br/>

      When you use GET, the form data will be visible in the page address:<br/>


      action_page.php?firstname=Mickey&lastname=Mouse<br/>




      Note<br/>
      GET is best suited to short amounts of data. Size limitations are set in your browser.</p>



      <h2>When to Use POST?</h2>

      <p>You should use POST:<br/>

      If the form is updating data, or includes sensitive information (password).<br/>

      POST offers better security because the submitted data is not visible in the page address.</p>
