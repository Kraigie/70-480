    The first rule in the user's style sheet in the following example contains an "!important" declaration,
    which overrides the corresponding declaration in the author's style sheet. The second declaration will
    also win due to being marked "!important". However, the third rule in the user's style sheet is not "!important"
    and will therefore lose to the second rule in the author's style sheet (which happens to set style on a
    shorthand property). Also, the third author rule will lose to the second author rule since the second
    rule is "!important". This shows that "!important" declarations have a function also within author style sheets.

    /* From the user's style sheet */
    p { text-indent: 1em ! important }
    p { font-style: italic ! important }
    p { font-size: 18pt }

    /* From the author's style sheet */
    p { text-indent: 1.5em !important }
    p { font: normal 12pt sans-serif !important }
    p { font-size: 24pt }
